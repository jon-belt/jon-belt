I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of East Anglia, with a strong passion for data science and software engineering. Currently, I am seeking opportunities to further my education and career through internships, apprenticeships, or graduate programs. I am open to both remote roles and positions based in Hertfordshire or London. My goal is to apply my skills and knowledge to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry while continuing to grow professionally.  When it comes to personal projects, my development starts with documentation and ideas, eventually spralling out into code and reality.  I take pride in what I do, regardless of what it is and always strive to acheive my best.
